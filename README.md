# Virtual Tabletop

A 2D browser-based virtual tabletop to play board games and card games online. Simulates cards, tokens, stacks, bags and other basic elements, but does not enforce any rules.

Fully customisable with user-provided images, to reproduce virtually any board game. Lua automation available to reduce tedious manipulations.

Inspired by cardgames.io, Tabletop Simulator and others.
